# Sys Admin Final Project

## Description

This project utilizes Docker containers to maintain a server hosting a WordPress application. Additionally, a database will be connected to the WordPress application. To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, multiple containers will be deployed across three GCP instances. This setup ensures that the server remains operational even if one instance or Docker container fails.
